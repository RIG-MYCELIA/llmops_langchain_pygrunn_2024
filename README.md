LLMOps with LangChain for the conference of PyGrunn in 2024

You need to have ollama installed locally, to be able to run LLMs
`brew install ollama`.

Make sure that Ollama is also running on your PC

Just using the ollama package from python is not enough, that is just an interface to the ollama running locally.
